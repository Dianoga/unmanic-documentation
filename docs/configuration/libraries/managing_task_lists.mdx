When Unmanic finds a file that needs processing, it will add it to the [pending tasks](/docs/dashboard/pending_tasks) list.

Under the **Library** section of Unmanic's settings, you have the option to configure if this task list is cleared each
time Unmanic starts.

<img className={"screenshot"} style={{ width: '400px' }} src={require('/img/unmanic-settings-library-pending-tasks.png').default} />

If selected, the Pending Tasks queue will be cleared whenever Unmanic starts.

:::tip
For larger libraries it is recommended to disable this option and preserve your Pending Tasks queue between Unmanic restarts.
