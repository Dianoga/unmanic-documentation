When Unmanic is carrying out a library scan, or a library is configured for file monitoring, all files detected by these
operations are tested using that library's configured *"File Test"* plugins. These plugins will determine if the file
should be added to the pending task list or not.

These file test operations carried out by the plugins do slow down the library scan process. However, Unmanic is designed
to carry out multiple file tests at the same time.

You can optimise how long it takes for Unmanic to carry out a library scan by tuning the **Concurrent file testers**
option under the **Library** section in Unmanic's settings.

Increasing this value will spawn more threads to concurrently test the files.
However, it will also use more CPU and RAM resources and on less powerful machines has more obvious diminishing returns.

It is recommended to initially set this value between 2 and 5 and increase it between library scans to determine the
optimal value.
