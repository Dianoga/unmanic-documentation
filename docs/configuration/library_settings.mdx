Under the **Library** section of your Unmanic settings you will find the ability to configure 
how you wish for Unmanic to manage your Library.

---


## Library Path

Set the path to your file library.

## Library Scanner

### Enable periodic library scans
Select this option if you wish for Unmanic to schedule a library scanner.

### Library scan schedule in minutes
Set the time in minutes between scans of your files in the configured library path.

### Run a one off library scan on startup
If selected, the library scan will be executed when Unmanic starts.

### Follow symlinks on library scans
If selected, the library scan will follow symlinks.

## Library file monitor

### Enable the library file monitor
If selected, Unmanic will start a process watching for any file modifications within your library.

:::note
This may cause errors on very large libraries. 
If you do have a large number of files on disk, search the internet for ["configuring Linux max_user_watches"](https://www.google.com/search?q=configuring+Linux+max_user_watches).
:::
:::caution
The file monitor will increase the RAM requirements of Unmanic and as such may not be a good option for
devices with limited RAM availability.
:::

## Pending tasks

### Clear all pending tasks on startup
If selected, the Pending Tasks queue will be cleared whenever Unmanic starts.

:::tip
For larger libraries it is recommended to disable this option and preserve your Pending Tasks queue between Unmanic restarts.
