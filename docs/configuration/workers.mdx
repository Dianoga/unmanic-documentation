Under the **Workers** section of your Unmanic settings you will find the ability to configure various aspects of your [Workers](/docs/dashboard/workers).

---


## Worker count

Set the number of concurrent workers that you wish this Unmanic installation to run.

:::tip
For most people, there is no benefit to running more than 3-5 Workers.
Depending on the type of tasks you carry out, you may find diminishing returns increasing this value beyond 5.

It is recommended to start with one worker initially, and then increase this value slowly until you find the right
balance of system resource use and Task processing speed.

## Worker event schedule

The Worker event schedule allows you to generate an ordered list of events that can modify the state of your Workers.

### Adding an event

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unmanic-settings-worker-event3.png').default} />

An event is configured to trigger at a repeating time.
It may be configured to:
- Set the Worker count
- Pause all Workers
- Resume all Workers


:::note
Scheduling the Worker count to reduce at a specified time will trigger the configuration change at that exact time.
However, if all Workers are currently processing Tasks, the actual Worker count will not reduce until the next Worker
becomes idle, at which point it will be terminated.
:::

### Setting the event order

<img className={"screenshot"} style={{ width: '400px' }} src={require('/img/unmanic-settings-worker-event-order.png').default} />

The configured worker events are executed from top to bottom. In some cases, you may whish for one event to come
**after** another.

This can be achieved by dragging the items in the list of configured events into order that suites your needs.


## Cache path

Set the location of the cache where Task files will be temporarily stored while workers are carrying out jobs on them.

:::tip
For faster processing of I/O bound tasks, such as video encoding, try setting this to a tmpfs (RAM).

However, do note that if you do this you will need to ensure that enough RAM is available to store the average file
size times the number of Workers that you are running.
