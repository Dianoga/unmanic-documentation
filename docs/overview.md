![DEMO](/img/unmanic-overview.gif "demo")


Unmanic is a simple tool for optimising your video library to a single, uniform format.

Unmanic provides you with the following main functions:

- A scheduler built in to scan your whole library for files that do not conform to your configured video presets. Videos found with incorrect formats are then queued for conversion.

- A folder watchdog. When a video file is modified or a new file is added in your library, Unmanic is able to check that video against your configured video presets. Like the first function, if this video is not formatted correctly it is added to a queue for conversion.

- A handler to manage running multiple file manipulation tasks at a time.

- A Web UI to easily configure, manage and monitor the progress of your library optimisation.

Simply configure Unmanic pointing it at your library and let it manage that library for you.
