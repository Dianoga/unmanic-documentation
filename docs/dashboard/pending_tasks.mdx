## What are Pending Tasks

A Task is generated whenever a file is discovered that requires processing by one or more [Plugins](/docs/plugins/overview).

The Pending Tasks are a list of file pointers that are currently awaiting to be picked up by the next available Worker.

Pending tasks are listed in order that they will be processed.


## Managing Pending Tasks

You will see more details regarding your Pending Tasks list if you expand the card by clicking the *Show more* icon in the top-right corner.

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unmanic-dashboard-pending-tasks-expanded.png').default} />

Once expanded you have the options to move a Task to either the top or bottom of the list, or to remove the items from your Pending Tasks list altogether.

From here you are also able to manually execute a scan of your Library.
