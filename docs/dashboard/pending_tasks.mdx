## What is Pending Tasks

A Task is generated whenever a file is discovered that requires processing by one or more Plugins.

The Pending Tasks are a list of file pointers that are currently awaiting to be picked up by the next available Worker.

Pending tasks are listed in order that they will be processed.


## Managing Pending Tasks

You may reorder Pending tasks by expanding the card.

![Dashboard - Pending Tasks Expanded](/img/unmanic-dashboard-pending-tasks-expanded.png "unmanic-dashboard-pending-tasks-expanded")

Once expanded you have the options to move a Task to either the top or bottom of the list.

You are also given the option to remove items from your Pending Tasks list.

From here you are also able to manually execute a scan of your Library.
