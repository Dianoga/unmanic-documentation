## What Are Workers

Workers carry out the main processing against your tasks.
Your workers run simultaneously, and you can configure Unmanic to have up to 12 concurrent workers at any time.
The number of workers that you choose to spawn should be determined based on your needs.



## Worker States

Workers can be in a number of states:

| State                                | Colour                                                  |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Idle                                 | <span style={{ color: 'var(--ifm-color-warning)' }}>YELLOW</span> |
| Processing - progress known          | <span style={{ color: 'var(--ifm-color-info)' }}>BLUE</span> (percent shown) |
| Processing - progress indeterminate  | <span style={{ color: 'var(--ifm-color-info)' }}>BLUE</span> (progress dialog spinning) |
| Paused - idle                        | <span style={{ color: 'var(--ifm-color-danger)' }}>RED</span> |
| Paused - processing                  | <span style={{ color: 'var(--ifm-color-danger)' }}>RED</span> (progress dialog spinning) |

#### Idle
An idle worker is ready to accept another task from the Pending Task queue.

#### Processing - progress known
The worker is currently processing a task.
The progress of the Plugin's command is able to be parsed.

#### Processing - progress indeterminate
The worker is currently processing a task.
The progress of the Plugin's command is not able to be parsed.

#### Paused - idle
The worker is paused and it currently has no task.

#### Paused - processing
The worker is paused. It does currently have a task assigned to it being processed.


## Worker Status

You may expand each worker card display more in-depth information about its current status.

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unmanic-dashboard-workers-status.png').default} />

Once expanded you will see, among other things, a live tail of the current command's log output.

You will also have an **Options** dropdown for pausing/resuming or terminating this individual worker and its current subprocess.
