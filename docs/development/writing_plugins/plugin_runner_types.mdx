## Library Management - File test

##### Executed:
After Unmanic carries out tests on a file to determine if it should be added to the task queue. Prior to returning a result of said tests.

##### Function:
`on_library_management_file_test(data)`

##### Provided data:
  - **`path`** - String containing the full path to the file being tested.
  - **`issues`** - List of currently found issues for not processing the file.
  - **`add_file_to_pending_tasks`** - Boolean, is the file currently marked to be added to the queue for processing.

##### Example:

<details>
<summary>plugin.py</summary>

For an up-to-date example, see the [Example Plugins Repo](https://github.com/Unmanic/unmanic-plugins/blob/examples/source/custom_ffmpeg_process/plugin.py)

```python
import os


def on_library_management_file_test(data):
    """
    Runner function - enables additional actions during the library management file tests.
    The 'data' object argument includes:
        path                            - String containing the full path to the file being tested.
        issues                          - List of currently found issues for not processing the file.
        add_file_to_pending_tasks       - Boolean, is the file currently marked to be added to the queue for processing.
    :param data:
    :return:
    """

    # Get the file extension
    file_extension = os.path.splitext(data.get('path'))[-1][1:]

    # Ensure the file's extension is lowercase
    file_extension = file_extension.lower()

    # If this is flash video file, add it to pending tasks
    if file_extension.lower() in ['flv']:
        data['add_file_to_pending_tasks'] = True

    return data
```
</details>


##### Details:

This Plugin runner should be used when you wish to create custom actions or tests to be carried
out on a file during the file test triggered by either the Library scan or the Library event watcher.

When you fail a test, you should also update the `issues` list provided in the `data` dictionary.

For example:
```python
data['issues'].append({
    'id':      '<PLUGIN NAME>',
    'message': "File should be ignored because <X>",
})
```

## Worker - Processing file

##### Executed:
Just prior to the execution of the FFmpeg subprocess within a Unmanic Worker process.

##### Function:
`on_worker_process(data)`

##### Provided data:
  - **`exec_ffmpeg`** - Boolean, should Unmanic run FFmpeg with the data returned from this plugin.
  - **`file_probe`** - A dictionary object containing the current file probe state.
  - **`ffmpeg_args`** - A list of Unmanic's default FFmpeg args.
  - **`file_in`** - The source file to be processed by the FFmpeg command.
  - **`file_out`** - The destination that the FFmpeg command will output.
  - **`original_file_path`** - The absolute path to the original library file.

##### Example:

<details>
<summary>plugin.py</summary>

For an up-to-date example, see the [Example Plugins Repo](https://github.com/Unmanic/unmanic-plugins/blob/examples/source/custom_ffmpeg_process/plugin.py)

```python
from unmanic.libs.unplugins.settings import PluginSettings
from unmanic.libs.system import System


class Settings(PluginSettings):
    """
    An object to hold a dictionary of settings accessible to the Plugin
    class and able to be configured by users from within the Unmanic WebUI.

    This class has a number of methods available to it for accessing these settings:

        > get_setting(<key>)            - Fetch a single setting value. Or leave the 
                                        key argument empty and return the full dictionary.
        > set_setting(<key>, <value>)   - Set a singe setting value.
                                        Used by the Unmanic WebUI to save user settings.
                                        Settings are stored on disk in order to be persistent.

    """
    settings = {
        "Execute FFmpeg": True,
        "Insert string into cache file name": "custom-string"
    }


def on_worker_process(data):
    """
    Runner function - carries out additional processing during the worker stages of a task.

    The 'data' object argument includes:
        exec_ffmpeg             - Boolean, should Unmanic run FFmpeg with the data returned from this plugin.
        file_probe              - A dictionary object containing the current file probe state.
        ffmpeg_args             - A list of Unmanic's default FFmpeg args.
        file_in                 - The source file to be processed by the FFmpeg command.
        file_out                - The destination that the FFmpeg command will output.
        original_file_path      - The absolute path to the original library file.

    :param data:
    :return:
    """
    settings = Settings()
    system = System()
    system_info = system.info()

    custom_string = settings.get_setting('Insert string into cache file name')

        tmp_file_out = os.path.splitext(data['file_out'])
        data['file_out'] = "{}-{}-{}{}".format(tmp_file_out[0], custom_string, tmp_file_out[1])

    if not settings.get_setting('Execute FFmpeg'):
        data['exec_ffmpeg'] = False

        

    return data
```
</details>


##### Details:

This Plugin runner should be used for carrying any custom FFmpeg command execution stages. 
The runner itself is only required to configure the parameters of the FFmpeg command execution.
The main Unmanic process will take the data dictionary returned from this runner and execute
the FFmpeg command within it's own shell.

## Post-processor - File movements

##### Executed:
Just prior to file copy operation from cached output file to source file's directory.

##### Function:
`on_postprocessor_file_movement(data)`

##### Provided data:

  - **`remove_source_file`** - Boolean, should Unmanic remove the original source file after all copy operations are complete.
  - **`copy_file`** - Boolean, should Unmanic run a copy operation with the returned data variables.
  - **`file_in`** - The converted cache file to be copied by the postprocessor.
  - **`file_out`** - The destination file that the file will be copied to.

##### Example:

<details>
<summary>plugin.py</summary>
