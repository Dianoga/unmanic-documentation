If you wish to create your own custom repository, follow these steps.


## Fork the GitHub repo

Start by logging into your github account and navigating the browser to this URL:
```
https://github.com/Unmanic/unmanic-plugins
```

Select the **Fork** button in the top right corner.

Ensure that the repository is not forked into your account.

## Configure a GitHub Token

We will rely on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to test, build, commit and push our repo to the "*repo*" branch of this git repository.

In order for GitHub Action workflow to do this, we need to add a secret variable to our repo that contains a authorisation token for our GitHub account.

Follow the guide provided [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
to generate a personal access token. Note down that token as once you have generated it, you cannot see it again.

You will need to create a personal access token authorised for the following things:

- repo (Full control of private repositories)
  - repo:status
  - repo_deployment
  - public_repo
  - repo:invite
  - security_events

:::warning
These tokens are sensitive and contain the ability to access/modify your GitHub account. 
Don't go sharing this information with anyone.
:::

Once you have done that, open the settings tab on your fork repo.

![Plugin Repo - Nav settings in fork of git repo](/img/unmanic-plugins-settings-tab-git-repo-fork.png "unmanic-plugins-settings-tab-git-repo-fork")

Then select **Secrets** and then **New repository secret**

![Plugin Repo - Create repo secret in fork of git repo](/img/unmanic-plugins-add-repo-secret-git-repo-fork.png "unmanic-plugins-add-repo-secret-git-repo-fork")

Enter the name as "**GH_TOKEN**" and then enter the value as the token you created following the steps in the link above.

Click the **Add secret** button.


## Clone your fork

Clone the forked repository from your GitHub profile.

![Plugin Repo - Clone git repo](/img/unmanic-plugins-clone-git-repo-fork.png "unmanic-plugins-clone-git-repo-fork")

Once you have cloned the repo, change directory to where you cloned it.

```
cd unmanic-plugins
```


## Checkout the template

Start by checking out the *template* branch. This branch contains the basic setup required to get started...

```
git checkout template
```

Create a new branch called *master* from the template branch

```
git checkout -b master
```

If this is the first time you have cloned this branch it is recommended to push at this point.

:::warning
Only carry out this step if you have not pushed to master before.
This will overwrite anything that already exists in your remote master branch.
:::

```
git push -f origin master
```


## Adding plugin source to repo

All plugin source files are added under the `source` directory.
These should be added under a directory named the same as the plugin ID.

Add the files to your source directory and commit.

Once you push your code back to GitHub, it will automatically build your repository into the **repo** branch, so long as you have configured your [GitHub Token](#configure-a-github-token)

## Cleanup branches

You should set your master branch as the default branch on your GitHub Fork.

To do this, open your GitHub fork in a browser and navigate to the branches screen.

![Plugin Repo - Show branches](/img/unmanic-plugins-show-branches-git-repo-fork.png "unmanic-plugins-show-branches-git-repo-fork")

Select the **Switch default branch** button.

![Plugin Repo - Switch default branch button](/img/unmanic-plugins-switch-default-branch-git-repo-fork-1.png "unmanic-plugins-switch-default-branch-git-repo-fork-1")

Select the **Switch to another branch** button. Select the *Master* branch. Then click **Update**.

![Plugin Repo - Switch default branch screen](/img/unmanic-plugins-switch-default-branch-git-repo-fork-2.png "unmanic-plugins-switch-default-branch-git-repo-fork-2")

Click the "*I understand, update the default branch.*" button.


## Update repo docs

The last step is to update your repository docs so that they reflect your newly created repository. 

By default, if you followed these steps, your README.md file will still be pointing to:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Unmanic/unmanic-plugins/repo/repo.json`

Open the `README.md` file and modify it accordingly.

For example, in the above URL, replace "*Unmanic/unmanic-plugins*" with "*JaneDoe/unmanic-plugins*".

Once you have done this, commit the change and push it to the master branch.

You are now all set to start using your own Unmanic Plugin Repository. You can do this by [Adding a Custom Repository](/docs/plugins/plugin_repos/adding_a_custom_repo) in Unmanic's web interface.
