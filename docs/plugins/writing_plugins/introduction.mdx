Writing Plugins for Unmanic should be easy. 

All that is required to get started is a basic knowledge of writing
Python scripts.


## Directory Structure

The directory structure of a Plugin should be:

```sh
my_new_plugin
├── changelog.txt
├── info.json
└── plugin.py
```


---
#### File: changelog.json

This file should be used to record changes made to the plugin.


---
#### File: info.json

A JSON file containing the metadata of your plugin.
This JSON file should contain the following data:

  - **`id`** - A string identifier for your Plugin. Should only contain lowercase `a-z` or `_` characters.
  - **`name`** - A very short name for your Plugin.
  - **`author`** - Your name.
  - **`version`** - The version of your plugin.
  - **`description`** - A long description of your Plugin detailing what it does. To include line-breaks, insert a `\n`.
  - **`icon`** - A URI to an image. If no icon is provided, the default Plugin icon will be used in the WebUI.
  - **`tags`** - A comma separated list able to be used as keywords when searching for Plugins.

##### Example:
```json
{
    "id": "reorder_subtitle_streams_by_language",
    "name": "Re-order subtitle streams by language",
    "author": "Josh.5",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "description": "Specify a language tag for Unmanic to try and put as 1st subtitle track.\n\nIn the plugin settings, specify a 'Search String'. The plugin will search the files to find matching subtitle tracks. The matching subtitle tracks will be moved to the 1st subtitle track position.\n\nExamples of search strings:\n  - 'en'\n  - 'fr'\n  - 'de'",
    "icon": ""
    "tags": "subtitle,ffmpeg,worker",
}
```

---
#### File: plugin.py

The main Pugin Python module.

This file will be imported and it's functions called byt he main Unmanic process.


## Plugin Module

The `plugin.py` file is a stand-alone Python module. From this module you may import other
modules as you see fit. There is no limitation on what may be executed within the 
[**runner**](#runners)
of your Plugin.


---
#### Runners

The Plugin module is made up of defined **runner** functions. A plugin may include multiple
runner functions such that it is executed at multiple stages of the library optimisation process,
however it is recommended that a Plugin carry out only a single task and therefore only include
a single runner function.

A **data** parameter is provided to the runner functions. This data parameter is a dictionary
object of information pertaining to that stage of the library optimisation process.
Whatever data schema is provided to a Plugin runner must also be returned at the end of that 
function. During the function, that data may be manipulated as you see fit. However, a Plugin 
runner may fail if data is removed from that data dictionary.

Plugins should be tested with the [**Plugin Manager CLI**](/docs/plugins/plugin_manager_cli) before publishing changes to ensure
that the returned data matches the required schema for all included runner functions.


##### Example:
```python
def on_worker_process(data):
    ...
    return data
```
