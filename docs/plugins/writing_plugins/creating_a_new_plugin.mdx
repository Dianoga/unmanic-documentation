The best option for creating a new Plugin for Unmanic is through the
[**Plugin Manager CLI**](/docs/plugins/plugin_manager_cli).

Once you have the Plugin Manager CLI installed, carry on.


## Generating a new Plugin
```bash
unmanic --manage_plugins
```

From here you will see a terminal output listing a number of options.

Select the option **"Create new plugin"** and follow the prompts.

Once this is complete, a new Plugin directory structure will be created
in your `~/.unmanic/plugins/` directory. Open this in your IDE of choice
and begin editing the files as necessary.

Be sure to test your Plugin with the [**Plugin Manager CLI**](/docs/plugins/plugin_manager_cli) as required.

:::tip

You can run the Plugin test functionality within the Plugin Manager CLI to 
`print(data)` or to test the functionality of your Plugin without needing
to run the main Unmanic process.
