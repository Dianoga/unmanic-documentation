All plugins are able to be configured using a "PluginSettings" class.

This job of this class is to hold a dictionary of settings accessible to the Plugin
class and able to be configured by users from within the Unmanic WebUI.

The `Settings` class should be included in your Plugin's `plugin.py` file if you wish 
to have the option of enabling configuration options for the Plugin's users.


##### Example

```python
from unmanic.libs.unplugins.settings import PluginSettings


class Settings(PluginSettings):
    """
    An object to hold a dictionary of settings accessible to the Plugin
    module and able to be configured by users from within the Unmanic WebUI.

    This class has a number of methods available to it for accessing these settings:

        > get_setting(<key>)            - Fetch a single setting value. Or leave the 
                                        key argument empty and return the full dictionary.
        > set_setting(<key>, <value>)   - Set a singe setting value.
                                        Used by the Unmanic WebUI to save user settings.
                                        Settings are stored on disk in order to be persistent.

    """
    settings = {
        "Boolean Option (will become checkbox in WebUI)": True,
        "Custom String Option (will become text input in WebUI)": "",
    }
```

#### *classmethod* **set_setting(** *key*, *value* **)**

    settings = Settings()
    enable_feature = settings.set_setting('Enable Feature', False)
```
