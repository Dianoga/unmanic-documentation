Unmanic features a Plugin system that enables extensibility to various sections of 
Unmnanic's task processing.

This site hosts an official repository of Plugins available to download within the 
Unmanic application.

Users are able to [develop their own Plugins](/docs/plugins/writing_plugins/introduction)
and either host them within their own repo or submit them to be included into the 
[official repository](https://github.com/Unmanic/unmanic-plugins/tree/official).


## What is a Plugin

Plugins are stand-alone Python modules that are executed at defined stages during
the library optimisation process.

At these specific stages of the library optimisation process, Unmanic will call
each enabled Plugin in turn and then, upon completion of the Plugin execution,
Unmanic will continue with subsequent process for that stage.

During a call to a Plugin, said plugin will be given a set of data pertaining to the state 
of a task or the information regarding the process about to be carried out. 
A Plugin may use this data to:

  - Manipulate the subsequent process.
  - Use that data to carry out functions outside of the scope of the Unmanic application.

A Plugin may be written such that it is executed at multiple stages of the library
optimisation process, however it is best practice to write a Plugin to carry out
only a single task.

## Plugins repositories

Unmanic hosts an official repository of plugins for Unmanic.

This is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Unmanic/unmanic-plugins/tree/official) under the "*official*" branch.

Anyone is able to provide Pull Request to update existing plugins or add new plugins to this repository.
Any additions will be vetted and tested to ensure they uphold the standard expected of official plugins.

If you wish to create your own repository to host or develop your own plugins, follow the guide here:
