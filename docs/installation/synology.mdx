Finish setting up the container and run for the first time. Check if everything's running properly.


## Some optional configuration steps:

### Adding HW-Acceleration capabilities:

Stop the container and export the settings to your local computer. 
Delete the container afterwards.

In the freshly downloaded .json file add the following text as shown in the picture below.
```
...

"devices": [{"CgroupPermissions": "rwm", "PathInContainer": "\/dev\/dri", "PathOnHost": "\/dev\/dri"}],

...
```

Import the modified .json file to your Synology NAS Docker Station and run the container.

Your Unmanic container should now be able to use HW-Acceleration with any supported Plugins.
